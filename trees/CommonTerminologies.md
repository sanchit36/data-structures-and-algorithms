# Tree

Tree is a non-linear data structure which organizes data in hierarchical structure and this is a recursive defination.

## Common Terminologies

### Root Node

- first node is the root node.
- each tree have only one root node.

### Edge

- The connecting link between any two nodes.
- The tree with **N** number of nodes will have max **N - 1** number of edges.

### Parent Node

- The node which is predecessor of any node.
- Node which have branch from it to any other node.

### Child Node

- The node which is descendant of any node.
- The node which have link from parent node.

### Siblings

- Nodes belong to the same parent.

### Leaf Node

- Node which does not have any child node.
- Also known as **Extenal Node** or **Terminal Node**.

### Internal Node

- Node with atleast one node.

### Degree of Node

- Total number of children of a node.
- Highest degree of a node among all the the nodes in a tree is known as **Degree of tree**.

### Level

- Each step from top to bottom in a tree is called Level.
- Root node is at level **0**.

### Height

- The total number of edges from the leaf node to a particular node in the longest path is called the **Height** of that node.
- Height of the root node == Height of the **tree**.
- Height of any **Leaf node** is **0**.

### Depth

- The total number of edges from root node to a particular node is called the **Depth** of that node.
- Total number of edges from root node to a leaf node in the longest path is said to be the **Depth of the tree**.
- Depth of the root node is **0**.

### Path

- The sequence of Nodes and Edges from one node to another node.
- **Lenght of the Path** is total number of the nodes in that path.

### Sub Tree

- Each child from a node forms a sub tree recursively.
